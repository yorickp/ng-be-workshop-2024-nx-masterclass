# `📖 Exercise:` Advanced workshop intro

Welcome to our Advanced Nx Workshop! We are happy to have you joining us on this journey.

Today you will learn how to:

- Create your own `generators` and `executors`
- Use your `executors` to enable `continuous deployment`
- Enable `Nx Cloud` to benefit from the `cache replay` and `distribution`
- Configure your `target inputs` to avoid having unexpected cache misses
- Investigate `cache misses` to understand what changed between your runs
- Use `Atomizer` to further break your long-running tasks apart
- Protect from `flaky` tests breaking your CI runs
- Use the latest `Powerpack` features
